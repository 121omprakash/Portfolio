üßë‚Äçüíª Functionality Breakdown
1. Visitor Counter
This feature increments the number of visitors on page load, and the count is stored in localStorage so the counter persists across sessions.

javascript
Copy code
// Initialize Visitor Count from localStorage
let visitorCount = localStorage.getItem('visitorCount');
if (!visitorCount) {
    visitorCount = 0; // Initialize if not set
}

// Increment Visitor Count
visitorCount++;
localStorage.setItem('visitorCount', visitorCount);

// Display the visitor count
document.getElementById('visitorCount').value = visitorCount;
2. Category Filtering
There are buttons for different categories: Computer Science (CS), Data Science (DS), Data Analytics (DA), and Software Engineering (SE). When a category is clicked, the relevant certifications are displayed while others are hidden.

javascript
Copy code
// Function to set the active category and show the relevant certificates
function setActiveCategory(categoryId) {
    // Show only relevant certificates
    certificationCards.forEach(card => {
        if (card.classList.contains(categoryId)) {
            card.classList.add('show');
        } else {
            card.classList.remove('show');
        }
    });
}
3. Confirmation Box
When a form is successfully submitted, a confirmation box appears with a smooth fade-in effect. Users can close it by clicking the close button.

javascript
Copy code
// Function to display confirmation box when form is submitted
function showConfirmationMessage() {
    document.getElementById('confirmationBox').style.display = 'flex';
}

// Handle closing of confirmation box
const closeBtn = document.getElementById('closeBtn');
if (closeBtn) {
    closeBtn.addEventListener('click', function () {
        document.getElementById('confirmationBox').style.display = 'none';
    });
}
üì± Responsive Design
This portfolio is built to be responsive, ensuring a great user experience on both mobile and desktop devices. The layout adjusts automatically based on the screen size, using CSS media queries for a mobile-first approach.

Example Media Query:
css
Copy code
@media (max-width: 768px) {
    .category-btn {
        font-size: 14px;
    }
    
    .certification-card {
        width: 100%;
        margin-bottom: 20px;
    }
}
üé® Custom Animations
